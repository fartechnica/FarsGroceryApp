Hi there!

This console-based application written in Java, by yours truly, functions (or at least attempts to) as a shopping list application, that allows you to create a user, (the credentials of which are encrypted and stored as ciphertext, check encrypted, the create login feature also has built-in language filtering, which I encourage you to test :>, the terms to block are in the Terms folder), login as that user, and create and store your own shopping lists, which you can edit, delete, and access.

You can compile and use the application by doing:

1. cd Project
2. javac Main.java
3. java Main.java

Have fun!
